Scantronulate is software to assist in autofilling
bubbles on scantron sheets based on information provided
by a spreadsheet.  It outputs a PDF that can be printed directly
onto scantrons.

To run, open 
	scantronulate.html
in a web browser.  Then proceed to open a CSV (comma separated values)
file containing the student information you wish to autofill with.

To add or edit the scantron metrics, edit
	js/config.js
